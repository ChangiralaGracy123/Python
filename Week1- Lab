print('The MPG is ${:,.2f}'.format(mpg))


The below questions answer consist of these three python files:
(Hello Name.py
Meal Purchased.py
Fahrenheit temperature.py)

Working on your own, complete the following programming exercises. Please be sure to review the  Programming Guidelines and Scoring Programming Guidelines and Scoring - Alternative Formats document before starting work on the assignment.
Write a program that prompts for the user's name and then greets the user by name. For example,
