2) A car's miles per gallon (MPG) can be calculated with the following formula:
MPG = Miles driven รท Gallons of gas used
Write a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons of gas used. It should calculate the car's MPG and display the result.
Show the instructor your work.
